# Cadence

Cadence comes from the idea of rhythmic flow and measured movement, which reflects this project’s goal of orchestrating coding agents in a steady, controlled delivery rhythm. As a fork of OpenAI’s Symphony, Cadence continues the orchestration metaphor—shifting from supervising individual agents to managing work as it flows through autonomous implementation runs.

Cadence turns project work into isolated, autonomous implementation runs, allowing teams to manage
work instead of supervising coding agents.

_In this [demo video](.github/media/symphony-demo.mp4), Cadence monitors a Linear board for work and spawns agents to handle the tasks. The agents complete the tasks and provide proof of work: CI status, PR review feedback, complexity analysis, and walkthrough videos. When accepted, the agents land the PR safely. Engineers do not need to supervise Codex; they can manage the work at a higher level._

## Running Cadence

### Requirements

Cadence works best in codebases that have adopted
[harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/). Cadence is the next step --
moving from managing coding agents to managing work that needs to get done.

### Option 1. Make your own

Tell your favorite coding agent to build Cadence in a programming language of your choice:

> Implement Cadence according to the following spec:
> https://github.com/laurentchindeko-APAC-CTIAdmin/cadence/blob/main/SPEC.md

### Option 2. Use our experimental reference implementation

Check out [elixir/README.md](elixir/README.md) for instructions on how to set up your environment
and run the Elixir-based Cadence implementation. You can also ask your favorite coding agent to
help with the setup:

> Set up Cadence for my repository based on
> https://github.com/laurentchindeko-APAC-CTIAdmin/cadence/blob/main/elixir/README.md
